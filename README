This is the MQP (senior project) from my college years. It was done using a three man team whom are described at the end of this README. This work represents work done during the summer between our Junior and Senior years. I wish I had known everything I know now, or even just senior year alone, before I did this project, but nonetheless whats done is done.

This does not represent all the work - there is significant amounts of mechanical drawings and design work, electrical drawings and design work, and of course the actual robot platform itself, which has gone missing.

The platform was later used as a model for the initial RBE3002 classes.

The team:
Keith Chester - me - all code and a decent amount of electrical work
Matt DeDonato - Eletrical head
Keith Meyers - Mechanical Design
